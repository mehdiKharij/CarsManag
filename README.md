To get started with the application, follow the instructions below.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cars-management.git
cd cars-management
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Images

If you donâ€™t already have the necessary Docker images, you can build them from the Dockerfiles in this project.

#### 2.1 Build the Frontend Image

```bash
docker build -t cars-mangem-frontend ./frontend
```

#### 2.2 Build the Backend Image

```bash
docker build -t cars-mangem-backend ./backend
```

#### 2.3 Verify the Created Images

You can verify that the images were successfully built by listing the available images:

```bash
docker images
```

### Step 3: Run the Application with Docker Compose

Once the images are ready (or downloaded), follow these steps to start the application using Docker Compose.

1. Make sure you're in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
